    <h3 class="center">GENERAL INFORMATION:</h3>
    <ul class="fixed-center">
      <p> I was born in Orange, California on March 29, 1989 and my family moved
        here when I was about 2 years old and I have lived in Utah ever since.
        I graduated from Davis High School in 2007 and entered the workforce
        immediately following graduation. In retrospect I should have probably
      gone to school before now, but live and learn.</p>

    <ul class="fixed center">
      <p>The only previous experience I have with coding is trying to teach
        myself for the past 5 or 6 months.  But I am hoping to gain enough
        knowledge in this course to make a career transition.  Other than that I
         have been in the work force in some form or another since I was 14
         years old in various jobs.  Currently I am an RSR(that's a route sales
         representative) for a company called Aramark Uniform Services.  We
         deliver and launder uniforms, rugs, aprons, bar towels, and various
         other items that our customers rent from us.</p>

    <h3 class="center">Biography:</h3>
    <ul class="fixed center">
      <p>I was born on March 29, 1989 in Orange, California.  My mom moved here
        when I was a little over 2 years old, and I have lived here in Utah ever
         since.  I have a total of 6 siblings(either whole or half) and I am the
          third oldest.  I went to Davis High School and graduated in 2007.  I
          met the love of my life when I was only 19 and we were married when we
           were both 20.  In the years since we have been married we have been
           through some crazy adventures but the best one of all is getting to
           be a Dad to my two amazing kids, Logan and Elleanor.  My son is named
            after the X-men character Wolverine, and my daughter is named for
            the character in the book Ella Enchanted.  I have been in the work
            force in some form or another since I was 14. My first job was at
            Lagoon.  Then i worked at Smiths Food and Drug.  Mostly I have
            worked in retail until I came to my current job at Aramark.  For
            the past 6 or 7 months I have felt like I needed to make a change in
             my life in regards to my career track and began to look at going
             back to school.  My wife had an old friend from school who is a
             web developer, so I began to ask him some questions about the
             field.  He directed me to look into a bootcamp rather than going
             back to get a degree like he had done.  After applying and being
             accepted I am excited to start this next chapter of my life and
             hopefully make a career transition into being a web developer.</p>
